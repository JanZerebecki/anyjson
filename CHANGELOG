0.1:

 * Initial release

0.1.1

 * Added benchmarking script
 * Added support for more serializer modules

0.2

 * Added exception handling so that all supported modules will result in the
   same exceptions being thrown. The exceptions are the same that are used
   by the JSON module from python 2.7, TypeError for serialize and
   ValueError for deserialize.
 * '''NOTE''' API changed. the implementation property is now an object, not
   a string
 * Rewrote module loading code, so it's now easier to add and rearrange
   JSON modules
